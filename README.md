# Google Analytics Real Time Visitor Counter Monitor

This is a simple script you can run from your web browser's console that monitors any change on Google Analytics Real Time General View's 
visitor counter. 

The first thing you have to do is to visit your Google Analytics account and then click on Real Time -> General view.
Then, open the browser's Javascript console (e.g. pressing F12 key). Once in the console, copy-paste the code of gartmon.js and hit ENTER.
From this point, the browser's tab will blink every time a new visitor comes or is gone.

## Creating a shortcut
Instead of copy-pasting this code every time you visit Google Analytics, you can create a special bookmark that, instead of having a usual
URL, it contains the code in the file "gartmon_shortcut.txt". Now, every time you visit the Real Time -> General view, you only have to hit on 
this bookmark to install the monitor. 


Enjoy!
